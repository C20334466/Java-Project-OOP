# Java-Project-OOP

Machine learning Project 

This purpose of this Java project will be to create a tool that predicts whether a student in secondary school will become an entrepreneur or not.

This tool will work by using previous examples of past secondary school students as a reference point. It will use examples of past students that later became entrepeneurs. We will also take into consideration variables like;

- Whether the student studied business during their time in secondary
- Had a part time job 
- Had a relative that owned a business 
- Gender of the student 

I will be using Na√Øve Bayes as the machine learning classifier.
